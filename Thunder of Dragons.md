The current Lord of Nightstone wears a ring that gives you control of two swords.
Notes on the Nightstone
We have found a secret ancient power within one of the scripts on the Nightstone. The Nightstone is called a “lockbox.” Leosin believed it was harboring a draconic power. It may be attracting local draconic powers. Wherever the stone goes, unnatural growth follows. Leosin took note that near a black dragon’s lair is surrounded by overgrowth of plants. 
In the Goblin Cave

We used the time-space-castle to communicate. Made Razorwind invisible and learned the extra spell. Using coup-de-tat we killed an ogre and then used a surprise round to kill the 2nd ogre. Removed all weapons from goblins.

The red wizards have been sighted moving north on the tradeway. They have been traveling in caravans so it is likely they are not transporting the eggs with them.

Nightstone – there is a mysterious fog moving southeast towards elterel. He thinks this is the floating city that stole the night stone. The floating city should be easy to infiltrate. Follow the spies are far as they will take you.

In the watch, I talk to the kid Tomas Lovestock. I created a dog and cats and an outdoor world for him.  He went out happy. Talked to Etim about ways to get them out. He premised a phylactery as a way to tie them back to the proper plane. Aerin suggested banishment as an option as well. 

# Stormhold Arc
## Session 1 - To Stormhold Castle
We departed to little commotion. For the 10-day downtime Orlin worked on Chronurgy magic studying with Etim and experimenting. Learned from Kidney to make bracers of defense we would need a dwarven enchanter as well as an elven one. 
We came upon a Roc in the air. Cast invisibility on Razorwind so Aerin and he could attack. Used rerolls to help with massive damage from razorwinds nat 20. Defeated the Roc via stunning. 
Upon arriving to the castle found it to be occupied by Orcs with wolf companions and a Chimera. We’re about to take on the occupiers when a young Black Dragon appeared and entered the castle. We chose guerilla tactics to try and reduce numbers. Challenged 3 orcs and 2 wolves. Since I was highest in the initiative immediately fireballed and destroyed the entire group.
## Session 2 - Taking the Castle - 5/22/22
After defeating the chimera and the juggernauts we looked around for loot and found 20gp and two potions. 
We proceeded to the dorms and found and found 500 gold pieces. 
We went up the south tower and found the ghost of [Lord Arad](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#lord-arad). Orlin took Aerin into the watch space and decided to have Aerin allow possession. He was allowed to know about defenses but not to share with the group. 

## Session 3 - Djinn and Ifrit
## Session 4 - Plane of Air - 6/3/22
**Starting XP: ????? | 20,086**

After defeating the Ifrit ([Abad-ar-Rahim][]) we explored the other tertiary rooms discovering some items:
* 2 mindstones (3),(1)
* Potion of Invisibility
* Vial of Deadly Poison
* Chest containing 500 Mithril coins bearing the image of Bearomar. Mithril=10PP

Bear communicates with [Kidney](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#kidney-beans) finding that they are in the plane of air. The luck had been taken by a crew under the service of [Halififth][]. They are being held. 

The group continues to distrust [Lord Arad](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#lord-arad) feeling he is not entirely forthcoming regarding his plans and we risk giving him what he wants by defeating [Sacha](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#sacha-baron-of-cohen). 

Using the Detect Thoughts spell Orlin was able to tap into [Arad's](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#lord-arad) mind. While Aerin questioned him Orlin was able to best him in several intelligence contests. It was revealed to Orlin that he had hidden an enchanted flask that would capture [Sacha](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#sacha-baron-of-cohen) upon his defeat. Orlin presented this to the party and the Baron. With the help of Bear and Aerin they smashed the enchanted flask removing its danger.

For efforts in saving him, the Baron offers us one wish. The party wished together for "*the castle to be fully repaired and fully staffed.*" Aerin dueled the Baron reducing his HIT points to 0 and releasing [Arad](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#lord-arad) to the afterlife "you fools" he shouted in anger. [Sacha](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#sacha-baron-of-cohen) was freed and departed as well leaving the portal to the plane of air open.

After a long rest the party departed through the plane of air making our way to the Palace of Ice and Steel. Sacha, introduced us to his father, the [Grand Caliph](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#grand-calip) of the plane of the Djinn. We convey word of the ordening breaking which grealty alarmed the court and encountered [Halififth](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#halififth). He tells us we can take our airship back. A locate object spell reveals it is close by.

As next steps we are introduced to to  the frost giant [Harshnag](https://github.com/uglyviking/Thunder-of-Dragons/blob/master/Thunder%20of%20Dragons.md#harshnag) who converses with us regarding the ordening. He was very much exasperated by the mention of Felgalos but found our witty naming of the ship entertaining. We found our ship empty but we were followed by a member of the crew of the Halififths Rage sent to spy on anyone approaching the ship. We forced him to take us to our crew and we released our people and reclaimed our treasure and items. The captain, an air genasi was angered and declared himself our enemy at which point combat ensues. Before we could finish him off he vanished. 

We went to the market and purchased some items. Orlin's were:
* Decanter of Endless Water (700).
* Barrier Tattoo (rare) for 2000 (the very rare was 20,000).

We speculated that our portal could be used as access to sell wood in the place of air.
